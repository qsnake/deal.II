# this used to be a whole perl script, but it has been superceded by a
# program written in C++ since it was too slow. if someone is still
# using the perl script, simply forward all actions to the C++
# executable
#
# since the perl script is not usually called from the directory which
# it is in, we need to have the path to the C++ executable. Autoconf
# does this for us upon configuration time.
