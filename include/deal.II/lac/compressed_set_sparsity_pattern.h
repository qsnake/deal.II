/**
 * This class acts as an intermediate form of the
 * SparsityPattern class. From the interface it mostly
 * represents a SparsityPattern object that is kept compressed
 * at all times. However, since the final sparsity pattern is not
 * known while constructing it, keeping the pattern compressed at all
 * times can only be achieved at the expense of either increased
 * memory or run time consumption upon use. The main purpose of this
 * class is to avoid some memory bottlenecks, so we chose to implement
 * it memory conservative, but the chosen data format is too unsuited
 * to be used for actual matrices. It is therefore necessary to first
 * copy the data of this object over to an object of type
 * SparsityPattern before using it in actual matrices.
 *
 * Another viewpoint is that this class does not need up front allocation of a
 * certain amount of memory, but grows as necessary.  An extensive description
 * of sparsity patterns can be found in the documentation of the @ref Sparsity
 * module.
 *
 * This class is an example of the "dynamic" type of @ref Sparsity. It
 * is discussed in the step-27 and @ref step_22
 * "step-22" tutorial programs.
 *
 * <h3>Interface</h3>
 *
 * Since this class is intended as an intermediate replacement of the
 * SparsityPattern class, it has mostly the same interface, with
 * small changes where necessary. In particular, the add()
 * function, and the functions inquiring properties of the sparsity
 * pattern are the same.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Use this class as follows:
 * @verbatim
 * CompressedSetSparsityPattern compressed_pattern (dof_handler.n_dofs());
 * DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern (dof_handler,
 *                                  compressed_pattern);
 * constraints.condense (compressed_pattern);
 *
 * SparsityPattern sp;
 * sp.copy_from (compressed_pattern);
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * See also step-11 and step-18 for usage
 * patterns of the related CompressedSparsityPattern class, and
 * step-27 of the current class.
 *
 * <h3>Notes</h3>
 *
 * There are several, exchangeable variations of this class, see @ref Sparsity,
 * section '"Dynamic" or "compressed" sparsity patterns' for more information.
 *
 * This class is a variation of the CompressedSparsityPattern class.
 * Instead of using sorted vectors together with a caching algorithm
 * for storing the column indices of nonzero entries, the std::set
 * container is used. This solution might not be the fastest in all
 * situations, but seems to work much better than the
 * CompressedSparsityPattern in the context of hp-adaptivity (see for
 * example step-27), or generally when there are many
 * nonzero entries in each row of a matrix (see @ref step_22
 * "step-22").  On the other hand, a benchmark where nonzero entries
 * were randomly inserted into the sparsity pattern revealed that this
 * class is slower by a factor 4-6 in this situation. Hence, currently
 * the suggestion is to carefully analyze which of the
 * CompressedSparsityPattern classes works best in a certain
 * setting. An algorithm which performs equally well in all situations
 * still has to be found.
