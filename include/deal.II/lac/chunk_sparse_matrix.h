 * Sparse matrix. This class implements the function to store values

 * done since one can store data elements of different type in these
 * locations without the SparsityPattern having to know this, and more
 * importantly one can associate more than one matrix with the same
 * sparsity pattern.

 * section on @ref Instantiations in the manual).
