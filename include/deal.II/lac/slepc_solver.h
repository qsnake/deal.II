/**
 * Base class for solver classes using the SLEPc solvers which are
 * selected based on flags passed to the eigenvalue problem solver
 * context. Derived classes set the right flags to set the right
 * solver. Note that: the <code>AdditionalData</code> structure is a
 * dummy structure that currently exists for backward/forward
 * compatibility only.
 *
 * The SLEPc solvers are intended to be used for solving the
 * generalized eigenspectrum problem $(A-\lambda B)x=0$, for $x\neq0$;
 * where $A$ is a system matrix, $B$ is a mass matrix, and $\lambda,
 * x$ are a set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors respectively. The
 * emphasis is on methods and techniques appropriate for problems in
 * which the associated matrices are sparse. Most of the methods
 * offered by the SLEPc library are projection methods or other
 * methods with similar properties; and wrappers are provided to
 * interface to SLEPc solvers that handle both of these problem sets.
 *
 * SLEPcWrappers can be implemented in application codes in the
 * following way:
 @verbatim
  SolverControl solver_control (1000, 1e-9);
  SolverArnoldi system (solver_control, mpi_communicator);
  system.solve (A, B, lambda, x, size_of_spectrum);
 @endverbatim
 * for the generalized eigenvalue problem $Ax=B\lambda x$, where the
 * variable <code>const unsigned int size_of_spectrum</code> tells
 * SLEPc the number of eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs to solve for: See
 * also <code>step-36</code> for a hands-on example.
 *
 * An alternative implementation to the one above is to use the API
 * internals directly within the application code. In this way the
 * calling sequence requires calling several of SolverBase functions
 * rather than just one. This freedom is intended for use of the
 * SLEPcWrappers that require a greater handle on the eigenvalue
 * problem solver context. See also the API of:
 @verbatim
  template <typename OutputVector>
  void
  SolverBase::solve (const PETScWrappers::MatrixBase &A,
                     const PETScWrappers::MatrixBase &B,
                     std::vector<double>             &kr,
                     std::vector<OutputVector>       &vr,
                     const unsigned int               n_eigenvectors)
  { ... }
 @endverbatim
 * as an example on how to do this.
