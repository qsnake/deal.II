/**
 * This class defines possible return states of linear solvers and
 * provides interfaces to a memory pool and the control object.
 *
 * <h3>Requirements for template classes</h3>
 *
 * Since iterative solvers do not rely on any special structure of
 * matrices or the format of storage, but only require that matrices
 * and vector define certain operations such as matrix-vector
 * products, or scalar products between vectors, this class as well as
 * the derived classes implementing concrete linear solvers are
 * templated on the types of matrices and vectors. However, there are
 * some common requirements a matrix or vector type must fulfill to
 * qualify as an applicable type for the solvers in this
 * hierarchy. These requirements are listed following. The listed
 * classes are not any concrete class, they are rather intended to
 * form a `signature' which a concrete class has to conform to. Note
 * that the matrix and vector classes within this library of course
 * conform to this interface; therefore, SparseMatrix and Vector are
 * good examples for these classes.
 *
 * @code
 * class Matrix
 * {
 *   public:
 *                        // Application of matrix to vector src.
 *                        // write result into dst
 *     void vmult (VECTOR &dst, const VECTOR &src) const;
 * 
 *                        // Application of transpose to a Vector.
 *                        // Only used by certain iterative methods.
 *     void Tvmult (VECTOR &dst, const VECTOR &src) const;
 * };
 *
 *
 * class VECTOR
 * {
 *   public:
 *                        // resize to have the same structure
 *                        // as the one provided and/or
 *                        // clear vector. note
 *                        // that the second argument must have
 *                        // a default value equal to false
 *     void reinit (const VECTOR&,
 *                  bool  leave_elements_uninitialized = false);
 *
 *                        // scalar product
 *     double operator * (const VECTOR &v) const;
 *
 *                        // addition of vectors
 *     void add (const VECTOR &x);
 *
 *                        // scaled addition of vectors
 *     void add (const double  a,
 *               const VECTOR &x);
 *
 *                        // scaled addition of vectors
 *     void sadd (const double  a,
 *                const double  b,
 *                const VECTOR &x);
 * 
 *                        // scaled assignment of a vector
 *     void equ (const double  a,
 *               const VECTOR &x);
 *
 *                        // scale the elements of the vector
 *                        // by a fixed value
 *     VECTOR & operator *= (const double a);
 *
 *                        // return the l2 norm of the vector
 *     double l2_norm () const;
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * In addition, for some solvers there has to be a global function
 * <tt>swap(VECTOR &a, VECTOR &b)</tt> that exchanges the values of the two vectors.
 *
 * The preconditioners used must have the same interface as matrices,
 * i.e. in particular they have to provide a member function @p vmult
 * which denotes the application of the preconditioner.
 *
 *
 * <h3>AdditionalData</h3>
 *
 * Several solvers need additional data, like the damping parameter @p omega
 * of the @p SolverRichardson class or the maximum number of temporary
 * vectors of the @p SolverGMRES.  To have a standardized constructor for
 * each solver class the <tt>struct AdditionalData</tt> has been introduced to each
 * solver class. Some solvers need no additional data, like @p SolverCG or
 * @p SolverBicgstab. For these solvers the struct @p AdditionalData is
 * empty and calling the constructor may be done without giving the additional
 * structure as an argument as a default @p AdditionalData is set by default.
 *
 * Now the generating of a solver looks like
 * @code
 *                               // GMRES with 50 tmp vectors
 * SolverGMRES solver_gmres (solver_control, vector_memory,
 *                           SolverGMRES::AdditionalData(50));
 *
 *                               // Richardson with omega=0.8
 * SolverRichardson solver_richardson (solver_control, vector_memory,
 *                                     SolverGMRES::AdditionalData(0.8));
 *
 *                               // CG with default AdditionalData
 * SolverCG solver_cg (solver_control, vector_memory);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Using a unified constructor parameter list for all solvers was introduced
 * when the @p SolverSelector class was written; the unified interface
 * enabled us to use this class unchanged even if the number of types of
 * parameters to a certain solver changes and it is still possible in a simple
 * way to give these additional data to the @p SolverSelector object for each
 * solver which it may use.
 *
