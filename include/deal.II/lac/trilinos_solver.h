 * Base class for solver classes using the Trilinos solvers. Since
 * solvers in Trilinos are selected based on flags passed to a generic
 * solver object, basically all the actual solver calls happen in this
 * class, and derived classes simply set the right flags to select one
 * solver or another, or to set certain parameters for individual
 * solvers. For a general discussion on the Trilinos solver package
 * AztecOO, we refer to the <a href =
 * "http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/aztecoo/AztecOOUserGuide.pdf">AztecOO
 * user guide</a>.
 *
 * This solver class can also be used as a standalone class, where the
 * respective Krylov method is set via the flag
 * <tt>solver_name</tt>. This can be done at runtime (e.g., when
 * parsing the solver from a ParameterList) and is similar to the
 * deal.II class SolverSelector.
