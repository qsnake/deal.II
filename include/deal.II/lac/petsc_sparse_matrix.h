                                        * is a very efficient way to do
                                        * this, as it uses the exact number
                                        * of nonzero entries for each row of
                                        * the matrix by using the given
                                        * sparsity pattern argument. If the
                                        * @p preset_nonzero_locations flag
                                        * is @p true, this function in
                                        * addition not only sets the correct
                                        * row sizes up front, but also
                                        * pre-allocated the correct nonzero
                                        * entries in the matrix.
                                        *
                                        * PETsc allows to later add
                                        * additional nonzero entries to a
                                        * matrix, by simply writing to these
                                        * elements. However, this will then
                                        * lead to additional memory
                                        * allocations which are very
                                        * inefficient and will greatly slow
                                        * down your program. It is therefore
                                        * significantly more efficient to
                                        * get memory allocation right from
                                        * the start.
                                        *
                                        * Despite the fact that it would
                                        * seem to be an obvious win, setting
                                        * the @p preset_nonzero_locations
                                        * flag to @p true doesn't seem to
                                        * accelerate program. Rather on the
                                        * contrary, it seems to be able to
                                        * slow down entire programs
                                        * somewhat. This is suprising, since
                                        * we can use efficient function
                                        * calls into PETSc that allow to
                                        * create multiple entries at once;
                                        * nevertheless, given the fact that
                                        * it is inefficient, the respective
                                        * flag has a default value equal to
                                        * @p false.
