 * An implementation of block vectors based on the vector class
 * implemented in TrilinosWrappers. While the base class provides for
 * most of the interface, this class handles the actual allocation of
 * vectors and provides functions that are specific to the underlying
 * vector type.
 *
 * The model of distribution of data is such that each of the blocks
 * is distributed across all MPI processes named in the MPI
 * communicator. I.e. we don't just distribute the whole vector, but
 * each component. In the constructors and reinit() functions, one
 * therefore not only has to specify the sizes of the individual
 * blocks, but also the number of elements of each of these blocks to
 * be stored on the local process.
