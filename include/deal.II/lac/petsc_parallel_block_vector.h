/**
 * An implementation of block vectors based on the parallel vector class
 * implemented in PETScWrappers. While the base class provides for most of the
 * interface, this class handles the actual allocation of vectors and provides
 * functions that are specific to the underlying vector type.
 *
 * The model of distribution of data is such that each of the blocks is
 * distributed across all MPI processes named in the MPI communicator. I.e. we
 * don't just distribute the whole vector, but each component. In the
 * constructors and reinit() functions, one therefore not only has to specify
 * the sizes of the individual blocks, but also the number of elements of each
 * of these blocks to be stored on the local process.
