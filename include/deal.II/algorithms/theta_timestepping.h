/**
 * Application class performing the theta timestepping scheme.
 *
 * The theta scheme is an abstraction of implicit and explicit Euler
 * schemes, the Crank-Nicholson scheme and linear combinations of
 * those. The choice of the actual scheme is controlled by the
 * parameter #theta as follows.
 * <ul>
 * <li> #theta=0: explicit Euler scheme
 * <li> #theta=1: implicit Euler scheme
 * <li> #theta=½: Crank-Nicholson scheme
 * </ul>
 *
 * For fixed #theta, the Crank-Nicholson scheme is the only second
 * order scheme. Nevertheless, further stability may be achieved by
 * choosing #theta larger than ½, thereby introducing a first order
 * error term. In order to avoid a loss of convergence order, the
 * adaptive theta scheme can be used, where <i>#theta=½+c dt</i>.
 *
 * Assume that we want to solve the equation <i>u' + Au = 0</i> with a
 * step size <i>k</i>.  A step of the theta scheme can be written as
 *
 * @f[
 *   (M + \theta k A) u_{n+1} = (M - (1-\theta)k A) u_n.
 * @f]
 *
 * Here, <i>M</i> is the mass matrix. We see, that the right hand side
 * amounts to an explicit Euler step with modified step size in weak
 * form (up to inversion of M). The left hand side corresponds to an
 * implicit Euler step with modified step size (right hand side
 * given). Thus, the implementation of the theta scheme will use two
 * Operator objects, one for the explicit, one for the implicit
 * part. Each of these will use its own TimestepData to account for
 * the modified step sizes (and different times if the problem is not
 * autonomous).
 *
 * <h3>Usage of vectors in NamedData</h3>
 *
 * ThetaTimestepping uses NamedData for communicating vectors. With
 * outer or inner Operator objects. It does not use itself the input
 * vectors provided, but forwards them to the explicit and implicit
 * operators.
 *
 * The explicit Operator #op_explicit receives in its input in first
 * place the vector <tt>"Previous iterate"</tt>, which is the solution
 * value after the previous timestep. It is followed by all vectors
 * provided to ThetaTimestepping::operator() as input
 * argument. #op_explicit is supposed to write its result into the
 * first position of its output argument, labeled <tt>"Result"</tt>.
 *
 * The implicit Operator #op_implicit receives the result of
 * #op_explicit in its first input vector labeled <tt>"Previous
 * time"</tt>. It is followed by all vectors provided to
 * ThetaTimestepping::operator() as input argument. The output of
 * #op_implicit is directly written into the output argument given to
 * ThetaTimestepping.
 *
 * <h3>Usage of ThetaTimestepping</h3>
 *
 * The use ThetaTimestepping is more complicated than for instance
 * Newton, since the inner operators will usually need to access the
 * TimeStepData. Thus, we have a circular dependency of information,
 * and we include the following example for its use. It can be found
 * in <tt>examples/doxygen/theta_timestepping.cc</tt>
 * 
 * @dontinclude theta_timestepping.cc
 *
 * First, we define the two operators used by ThetaTimestepping and
 * call them <code>Implicit</code> and <code>Explicit</code>. They
 * both share the public interface of Operator, and additionally
 * provide storage for the matrices to be used and a pointer to
 * TimestepData. Note that we do not use a SmartPointer here, since
 * the TimestepData will be destroyed before the operator.
 *
 * @skip class Explicit
 * @until End of declarations
 *
 * These operators will be implemented after the main program. But let
 * us look at how they get used. First, let us define a matrix to be
 * used for our system and also an OutputOperator in order to write
 * the data of each timestep to a file.
 *
 * @skipline main
 * @until out.initialize
 *
 * Now we create objects for the implicit and explicit parts of the
 * steps as well as the ThetaTimestepping itself. Notice how the
 * TimestepData of ThetaTimestepping gets forwarded to the inner
 * operators. There are two different data objects, because the
 * timestep size is modified by #theta.
 *
 * @until set_output
 *
 * The next step is providing the vectors to be used. <tt>value</tt>
 * is filled with the initial value and is also the vector where the
 * solution at each timestep will be. Because the interface of
 * Operator has to be able to handle several vectors, we need to store
 * it in a NamedData object. Notice, that we need to create the
 * intermediate pointer <tt>p</tt>. If we would use
 * <code>&value</code> directly in the <code>add</code> function, the
 * resulting object would be constant.
 *
 * @until add
 *
 * Finally, we are ready to tell the solver, that we are looknig at
 * the initial timestep and run it.
 *
 * @until outdata
 * @skip Explicit::initialize
 *
 * Now we need to study the application of the implicit and explicit
 * operator. We assume that the pointer <code>matrix</code> points to
 * the matrix created in the main program, and that
 * <code>timestep_data</code> points to the correct data object of
 * ThetaTimestepping.
 *
