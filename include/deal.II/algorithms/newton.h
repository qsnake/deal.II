/**
 * Operator class performing Newton's iteration with standard step
 * size control and adaptive matrix generation.
 *
 * This class performes a Newton iteration up to convergence
 * determined by #control. If after an update the norm of the residual
 * has become larger, then step size control is activated and the
 * update is subsequently divided by two until the residual actually
 * becomes smaller (or the minimal scaling factor determined by
 * #n_stepsize_iterations is reached).
 *
 * Since assembling matrices, depending on the implementation, tends
 * to be costly, this method applies an adaptive reassembling
 * strategy. Only if the reduction factor for the residual is more
 * than #threshold, the event Algorithms::bad_derivative is submitted to
 * #inverse_derivative. It is up to this object to implement
 * reassembling accordingly.
 *
 * <h3>Contents of the NamedData objects</h3>
 *
 * The only value used by the Newton method is the first vector in the
 * parameter <tt>out</tt> of operator()(). It serves as the start
 * vector of Newton's method and in the end contains the solution. All
 * other vectors of <tt>out</tt> are ignored by Newton's method and
 * its inner Operator objects. All vectors of <tt>in</tt> are forwarded to
 * the inner Operator objects, with additional information added as follows.
 *
 * When calling (*#residual)(), the NamedData <tt>in</tt> given to the
 * Newton iteration is prepended by a vector <tt>"Newton iterate"</tt>,
 * the current value of the Newton iterate, which can be used to
 * evaluate the residual at this point.
 *
 * For the call to (*#inverse_derivative), the vector <tt>"Newton
 * residual"</tt> is inserted before <tt>"Newton iterate"</tt>.
