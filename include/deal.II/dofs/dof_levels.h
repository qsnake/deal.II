/**    
 *
 * <h4>DoFLevel@<0@></h4>
 *
 * This class is the common base class for all the DoFLevel
 * classes. We here store information that is associated with
 * (logical) cells, rather than concrete objects such as lines, quads,
 * or hexes.
 *
 * At present, all we store are cached values for the DoF indices on
 * each cell, since this is a frequently requested operation. The
 * values are set by DoFCellAccessor::update_cell_dof_indices_cache
 * and are used by DoFCellAccessor::get_dof_indices.
 *
 * Note that vertices are separate from, and in fact have nothing to
 * do with cells. The indices of degrees of freedom located on
 * vertices therefore are not stored here, but rather in member
 * variables of the dealii::DoFHandler class.
 *
 * The indices of degrees of freedom located on lower dimensional
 * objects, i.e. on lines for 2D and on quads and lines for 3D are
 * treated similarly than that on cells. However, theses geometrical
 * objects, which are called faces as a generalisation, are not
 * organised in a hierachical structure of levels. Therefore, the
 * degrees of freedom located on these objects are stored in seperate
 * classes, namely the <tt>DoFFaces</tt> classes.
 *
 *
 * <h4>DoFLevel@<1@>, DoFLevel@<2@>, and DoFLevel@<3@> </h4>
 *
 * These classes are used, respectively, to store the indices located
 * on lines, quads, and hexes. The storage format is as laid out
 * above, and data is stored in objects lines, quads, and
 * hexes, which are all instantiations of <tt>DoFObjects</tt>.
 * However, it isn't usually directly accessed. Rather,
 * except for some access from the DoFHandler class, access is usually
 * through the DoFAccessor::set_dof_index() and
 * DoFAccessor::dof_index() functions or similar functions of derived
 * classes that in turn access the member variables using the
 * DoFHandler::get_dof_index() and corresponding setter functions.
 * Knowledge of the actual data format is therefore
 * encapsulated to the present hierarchy of classes as well as the
 * dealii::DoFHandler class.
