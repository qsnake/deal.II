/**    
 *
 * <h4>DoFFaces</h4>
 *
 * These classes are similar to the DoFLevel classes. We here store information
 * that is associated with faces, rather than cells, as this information is independent of
 * the hierachical structure of cells, which are organized in levels. In 2D we store
 * information on degrees of freedom located on lines whereas in 3D we store information on
 * drefrees of freedom located on quads and lines. In 1D we do nothing, as the faces of
 * lines are vertices which are treated seperately.
 *
 * Apart from the DoFObjects object containing the data to store (degree of freedom
 * indices) we do not store any data or provide any functionality. However, we do implement
 * a function to determine an estimate of the memory consumption of the contained
 * DoFObjects object(s).
 *
 * The data contained isn't usually directly accessed. Rather, except for some access from
 * the DoFHandler class, access is usually through the DoFAccessor::set_dof_index() and
 * DoFAccessor::dof_index() functions or similar functions of derived classes that in turn
 * access the member variables using the DoFHandler::get_dof_index() and corresponding
 * setter functions. Knowledge of the actual data format is therefore encapsulated to the
 * present hierarchy of classes as well as the dealii::DoFHandler class.
