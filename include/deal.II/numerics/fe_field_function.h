/**
 * This is an interpolation function for the given dof handler and
 * the given solution vector. The points at which this function can
 * be evaluated MUST be inside the domain of the dof handler, but
 * except from this, no other requirement is given. This function is
 * rather slow, as it needs to construct a quadrature object for the
 * point (or set of points) where you want to evaluate your finite
 * element function. In order to do so, it needs to find out where
 * the points lie.
 *
 * If you know in advance in which cell your points lye, you can
 * accelerate things a bit, by calling set_active_cell before
 * asking for values or gradients of the function. If you don't do
 * this, and your points don't lie in the cell that is currently
 * stored, the function GridTools::find_cell_around_point is called
 * to find out where the point is. You can specify an optional
 * mapping to use when looking for points in the grid. If you don't
 * do so, this function uses a Q1 mapping.
 *
 * Once the FEFieldFunction knows where the points lie, it creates a
 * quadrature formula for those points, and calls
 * FEValues::get_function_values or FEValues::get_function_grads with
 * the given quadrature points.
 *
 * If you only need the quadrature points but not the values of the
 * finite element function (you might want this for the adjoint
 * interpolation), you can also use the function @p
 * compute_point_locations alone.
 *
 * An example of how to use this function is the following:
 *    
 * \code
 * 
 * // Generate two triangulations
 * Triangulation<dim> tria_1;
 * Triangulation<dim> tria_2;
 *
 * // Read the triangulations from files, or build them up, or get
 * // them from some place...  Assume that tria_2 is *entirely*
 * // included in tria_1
 * ...
 *
 * // Associate a dofhandler and a solution to the first
 * // triangulation
 * DoFHandler<dim> dh1(tria_1);
 * Vector<double> solution_1;
 *
 * // Do the same with the second
 * DoFHandler<dim> dh2;
 * Vector<double> solution_2;
 *
 * // Setup the system, assemble matrices, solve problems and get the
 * // nobel prize on the first domain...
 * ...
 *
 * // Now project it to the second domain
 * FEFieldFunction<dim> fe_function_1 (dh_1, solution_1);
 * VectorTools::project(dh_2, constraints_2, quad, fe_function_1, solution_2);
 *
 * // Or interpolate it...
 * Vector<double> solution_3;
 * VectorTools::interpolate(dh_2, fe_function_1, solution_3);
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * The snippet of code above will work assuming that the second
 * triangulation is entirely included in the first one. 
 *
 * FEFieldFunction is designed to be an easy way to get the results of
 * your computations across different, possibly non matching,
 * grids. No knowledge of the location of the points is assumed in
 * this class, which makes it rely entirely on the
 * GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point utility for its
 * job. However the class can be fed an "educated guess" of where the
 * points that will be computed actually are by using the
 * FEFieldFunction::set_active_cell method, so if you have a smart way to
 * tell where your points are, you will save a lot of computational
 * time by letting this class know.
 *
 * An optimization based on a caching mechanism was used by the
 * author of this class for the implementation of a Finite Element
 * Immersed Boundary Method.
