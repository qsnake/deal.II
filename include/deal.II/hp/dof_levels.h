/**
 * Store the indices of the degrees of freedom which are located on
 * objects of dimension @p N. We declare this general template
 * class, but do not actually use it. Rather, only specializations of
 * this class are used.
 *
 * The things we store here is very similar to what is stored in the
 * internal::DoFHandler::DoFLevel class hierarchy (see there for more
 * information, in particular on the layout of the class hierarchy,
 * and the use of file names). There are two main
 * differences, discussed in the following subsections. In addition to
 * the data already stored by the internal::DoFHandler::DoFLevel
 * classes, we also have to store which finite element each cell
 * uses. This is done in the DoFLevel<0> class, where for each cell we
 * have an entry within the active_fe_indices field.
 *
 * 
 * <h4>Offset computations</h4>
 * 
 * For hp methods, not all cells may use the same finite element, and
 * it is consequently more complicated to determine where the DoF
 * indices for a given line, quad, or hex are stored. As described in
 * the documentation of the internal::DoFHandler::DoFLevel class, we
 * can compute the location of the first line DoF, for example, by
 * calculating the offset as <code>line_index *
 * dof_handler.get_fe().dofs_per_line</code>. This of course doesn't
 * work any more if different lines may have different numbers of
 * degrees of freedom associated with them. Consequently, rather than
 * using this simple multiplication, each of the lines.dofs, quads.dofs,
 * and hexes.dofs arrays has an associated array lines.dof_offsets,
 * quads.dof_offsets, and hexes.dof_offsets. The data corresponding to a
 * line then starts at index <code>line_dof_offsets[line_index]</code>
 * within the <code>line_dofs</code> array. 
 *
 *
 * <h4>Multiple data sets per object</h4>
 *
 * If an object corresponds to a cell, the global dof indices of this
 * cell are stored at the location indicated above in sequential
 * order.
 * 
 * However, if two adjacent cells use different finite elements, then
 * the face that they share needs to store DoF indices for both
 * involved finite elements. While faces therefore have to have at
 * most two sets of DoF indices, it is easy to see that vertices for
 * example can have as many sets of DoF indices associated with them
 * as there are adjacent cells, and the same holds for lines in 3d.
 *
 * Consequently, for objects that have a lower dimensionality than
 * cells, we have to store a map from the finite element index to the
 * set of DoF indices associated. Since real sets are typically very
 * inefficient to store, and since most of the time we expect the
 * number of individual keys to be small (frequently, adjacent cells
 * will have the same finite element, and only a single entry will
 * exist in the map), what we do is instead to store a linked list. In
 * this format, the first entry starting at position
 * <code>lines.dofs[lines.dof_offsets[line_index]]</code> will denote
 * the finite element index of the set of DoF indices following; after
 * this set, we will store the finite element index of the second set
 * followed by the corresponding DoF indices; and so on. Finally, when
 * all finite element indices adjacent to this object have been
 * covered, we write a -1 to indicate the end of the list.
 *
 * Access to this kind of data, as well as the distinction between
 * cells and objects of lower dimensionality are encoded in the
 * accessor functions, DoFObjects::set_dof_index() and
 * DoFLevel::get_dof_index() They are able to traverse this
 * list and pick out or set a DoF index given the finite element index
 * and its location within the set of DoFs corresponding to this
 * finite element.
