template <typename number> class Vector;

/**
 * This class is a model for a general function. It serves the purpose
 * of representing scalar and vector valued functions. To this end, we
 * consider scalar functions as a special case of vector valued
 * functions, in the former case only having a single component return
 * vector. Since handling with vectors is comparatively expensive,
 * functions are provided which only ask for a single component of the
 * function, which is what you will usually need in case you know that
 * your function is scalar-valued.
 *
 * Access to function objects therefore is through the following
 * methods:
 * @code
 *                 // access to one component at one point
 *   double value        (const Point<dim>   &p,
 *                        const unsigned int  component = 0) const;
 *
 *                 // return all components at one point
 *   void   vector_value (const Point<dim>   &p,
 *                        Vector<double>     &value) const;
 * @endcode
 *
 * For more efficiency, there are other functions returning one or all
 * components at a list of points at once:
 * @code
 *                 // access to one component at several points
 *   void   value_list (const std::vector<Point<dim> >  &point_list,
 *                      std::vector<double>             &value_list,
 *                      const unsigned int  component = 0) const;
 *
 *                 // return all components at several points
 *   void   vector_value_list (const std::vector<Point<dim> >    &point_list,
 *                             std::vector<Vector<double> >      &value_list) const;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Furthermore, there are functions returning the gradient of the
 * function at one or several points.
 *
 * You will usually only overload those functions you need; the
 * functions returning several values at a time (value_list(),
 * vector_value_list(), and gradient analoga) will call those
 * returning only one value (value(), vector_value(), and gradient
 * analoga), while those ones will throw an exception when called but
 * not overloaded.
 *
 * Note however, that the functions returning all components of the
 * function at one or several points (i.e. vector_value(),
 * vector_value_list()), will not call the function returning one
 * component at one point repeatedly, once for each point and
 * component. The reason is efficiency: this would amount to too many
 * virtual function calls. If you have vector-valued functions, you
 * should therefore also provide overloads of the virtual functions
 * for all components at a time.
 *
 * Also note, that unless only called a very small number of times,
 * you should overload all sets of functions (returning only one
 * value, as well as those returning a whole array), since the cost of
 * evaluation of a point value is often less than the virtual function
 * call itself.
 *
 *
 * Support for time dependant functions can be found in the base
 * class FunctionTime.
 *
 * @note if the functions you are dealing with have sizes which
 * are a priori known (for example, <tt>dim</tt> elements), you might
 * consider using the TensorFunction class instead.
