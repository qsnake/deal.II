/**
 * This class provides a collection of functions for generating basic
 * triangulations. Below, we try to provide some pictures in order to
 * illustrate at least the more complex ones.
 *
 * Some of these functions receive a flag @p colorize. If this is
 * set, parts of the boundary receive different boundary numbers,
 * allowing them to be distinguished by application programs. See the
 * documentation of the functions for details.
 *
 * Additionally this class provides a function
 * (@p laplace_transformation) that smoothly transforms a grid
 * according to given new boundary points. This can be used to
 * transform (simple-shaped) grids to a more complicated ones, like a
 * shell onto a grid of an airfoil, for example.
 *
 * No meshes for the codimension one case are provided at the moment.
