				    * In addition, this function may be

				    * cells on the surface mesh to the
				    * corresponding faces on the volume
				    * one. This mapping is the return value

				    *
				    * @note The function builds the surface

				    * of the volume mesh. It copies the
				    * boundary indicators of these faces to
				    * the cells of the coarse surface
				    * mesh. The surface mesh is then refined
				    * in the same way as the faces of the
				    * volume mesh are. In order to ensure

				    * appropriate boundary objects through
				    * Triangulation::set_boundary to the
				    * surface mesh object before calling
				    * this function. If you don't, the
				    * refinement will happen under the
				    * assumption that all faces are straight
				    * (i.e using the StraightBoundary class)
				    * rather than any curved boundary object
				    * you may want to use to determine the
				    * location of new vertices.
				    *
				    * @note Oftentimes, the
				    * <code>Container</code>
				    * template type will be of kind
				    * Triangulation; in that case,
				    * the map that is returned will
				    * be between Triangulation cell
				    * iterators of the surface mesh
				    * and Triangulation face
				    * iterators of the volume
				    * mesh. However, one often needs
				    * to have this mapping between
				    * DoFHandler (or hp::DoFHandler)
				    * iterators. In that case, you
				    * can pass DoFHandler arguments
				    * as first and second parameter;
				    * the function will in that case
				    * re-build the triangulation
				    * underlying the second argument
				    * and return a map between
				    * DoFHandler iterators. However,
				    * the function will not actually
				    * distribute degrees of freedom
				    * on this newly created surface
				    * mesh.
				    *
				    * @note The algorithm outlined
				    * above assumes that all faces
				    * on higher refinement levels
				    * always have exactly the same
				    * boundary indicator as their
				    * parent face. Consequently, we
				    * can start with coarse level
				    * faces and build the surface
				    * mesh based on that. It would
				    * not be very difficult to
				    * extend the function to also
				    * copy boundary indicators from
				    * finer level faces to their
				    * corresponding surface mesh
				    * cells, for example to
				    * accomodate different geometry
				    * descriptions in the case of
				    * curved boundaries.
