/**
 * Collection of functions controlling refinement and coarsening of
 * Triangulation objects.
 *
 * The functions in this namespace are in two classes. There are the
 * auxiliary functions refine() and coarsen(). More important for
 * users are the other functions, which implement refinement
 * strategies, as being found in the literature on adaptive finite
 * element methods. For mathematical discussion of these methods,
 * consider works by D&ouml;rfler, Morin, Nochetto, Rannacher,
 * Stevenson and many more.

/**
 * This function provides a refinement strategy with predictable growth of the mesh.
 *
 * The function takes a vector of refinement @p criteria and two values
 * between zero and one denoting the fractions of cells to be refined
 * and coarsened. It flags cells for further processing by
 * Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement() according to the
 * following greedy algorithm:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 *  <li> Sort the cells according to descenting values of @p criteria.
 *
 *  <li> Set the refinement threshold to be the criterion belonging to
 *  the cell at position @p top_fraction_of_cells times
 *  Triangulation::n_active_cells().
 *
 * <li> Set the coarsening threshold accordingly using the cell @p
 *  bottom_fraction_of_cells times Triangulation::n_active_cells()
 *  from the end of the sorted list.
 *
 *  <li> Use these two thresholds in calls to refine() and coarsen(),
 *  respectively.
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * As an example, with no coarsening, setting @p top_fraction_of_cells
 * to 1/3 will result in approximately doubling the number of cells in
 * two dimensions. The same effect in three dimensions is achieved by
 * refining 1/7th of the cells. These values are good initial guesses,
 * but should be adjusted depending on the singularity of approximated
 * function.
 *
 * The sorting of criteria is not done actually, since we only need
 * the threshold values in order to call refine() and coarsen(). The
 * order of cells with higher and of those with lower criteria is
 * irrelevant. Getting this value is accomplished by the @p
 * nth_element function of the <tt>C++</tt> standard library, which
 * takes only linear time in the number of elements, rather than <tt>N
 * log N</tt> for sorting all values.
 *
 * @warning This function only sets the coarsening and refinement
 * flags. The mesh is not changed until you call
 * Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement().
 *
 * @arg @p criteria: the refinement criterion computed on each mesh
 * cell. Entries may not be negative.
 *
 * @arg @p top_fraction_of_cells is the fraction of cells to be
 * refined. If this number is zero, no cells will be refined. If it
 * equals one, the result will be flagging for global refinement.
 *
 * @arg @p bottom_fraction_of_cells is the fraction of cells to be
 * coarsened. If this number is zero, no cells will be coarsened.
 *
 * @arg @p max_n_cells can be used to specify a maximal number of
 * cells. If this number is going to be exceeded upon refinement, then
 * refinement and coarsening fractions are going to be adjusted in an
 * attempt to reach the maximum number of cells. Be aware though that
 * through proliferation of refinement due to
 * Triangulation::MeshSmoothing, this number is only an indicator. The
 * default value of this argument is to impose no limit on the number
 * of cells.

/**
 * This function provides a refinement strategy controlling the
 * reduction of the error estimate.
 *
 * Also known as the <b>bulk criterion</b>, this function computes the
 * thresholds for refinement and coarsening such that the @p criteria
 * of cells getting flagged for refinement make up for a certain
 * fraction of the total error. We explain its operation for
 * refinement, coarsening works analogously.
 *
 * Let <i>c<sub>K</sub></i> be the criterion of cell <i>K</i>. Then
 * the total error estimate is computed by the formula
 * @f[
 * E = \sum_{K\in \cal T} c_K.
 * @f]
 *
 * If <i> 0 &lt; a &lt; 1</i> is @p top_fraction, then we refine the
 * smallest subset $\cal M$ of the Triangulation $\cal T$ such that
 * @f[
 * a E \le \sum_{K\in \cal M} c_K
 * @f]
 *
 * The algorithm is performed by the greedy algorithm described in
 * refine_and_coarsen_fixed_number().
 *
 * @note The often used formula with squares on the left and right is
 * recovered by actually storing the square of <i>c<sub>K</sub></i> in
 * the vector @p criteria.
 *
 * From the point of view of implementation, this time we really need
 * to sort the array of criteria.  Just like the other strategy
 * described above, this function only computes the threshold values
 * and then passes over to refine() and coarsen().
 *  
 * @arg @p criteria: the refinement criterion computed on each mesh
 * cell. Entries may not be negative.
 *
 * @arg @p top_fraction is the fraction of the total estimate which
 * should be refined. If this number is zero, no cells will be refined. If it
 * equals one, the result will be flagging for global refinement.
 *
 * @arg @p bottom_fraction is the fraction of the estimate
 * coarsened. If this number is zero, no cells will be coarsened.
 *
 * @arg @p max_n_cells can be used to specify a maximal number of
 * cells. If this number is going to be exceeded upon refinement, then
 * refinement and coarsening fractions are going to be adjusted in an
 * attempt to reach the maximum number of cells. Be aware though that
 * through proliferation of refinement due to
